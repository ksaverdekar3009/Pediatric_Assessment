This web application is developed using PHP and Firebase. Additionally, I have utilized Google App Script to synchronize Firebase data with Google Sheets.

Pediatric Assessment is an web application designed for students in the nursing department to assist them in managing newborn babies' data and conducting further assessments. It includes features such as searching, BMI calculation, APGAR scoring, anthropometric measurements, growth charts, expected date of delivery (EDD) calculation, and immunization schedules (which automatically schedule vaccine dates and times based on previous vaccines and the child's date of birth).

There is also an admin module which allows administrators to approve or deny registration requests from users and to view all user activity and children added by the users. Admins can also approve or deny edit requests for children.
